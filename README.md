# Workflow-Optimization-Files
 
A case study on optimizing a university library borrowing & return process_

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how **data-driven insights** can be applied to optimize workflows.  
selected the **library book borrowing and return workflow** as a case study because it is relatable, has measurable bottlenecks, and directly impacts user experience.  

The project applies **descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics** to improve efficiency.  
It also includes a queue simulation using SimPy to test optimization strategies.  


## Objectives  
- Identify inefficiencies in the borrowing/return workflow.  
- Analyze system logs and staff schedules to uncover bottlenecks.  
- Simulate possible improvements using data-driven models 
- Recommend practical optimizations (e.g., kiosks, mobile payments, staff reallocation).
